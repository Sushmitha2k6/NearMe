            Cuddalore Port, located in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, India, is a historically significant maritime facility situated at the confluence of the Gedilam and Paravanar rivers, opening into the Bay of Bengal. Once a bustling hub during the British colonial era, the port has experienced periods of dormancy but is currently undergoing revitalization efforts to enhance its role in regional trade and industry.​

Historical Significance
During the British colonial period, Cuddalore Port served as a vital point for maritime trade and military operations. The British established Fort St. David in 1653 near the port, which became a strategic military base. Over time, the port's prominence declined, and it transitioned to primarily supporting fishing activities.​

Current Infrastructure and Operations
Cuddalore Port is classified as a minor port and functions as an open roadstead anchorage. Vessels anchor offshore, and cargo is transferred using lighters and steel barges. The port handles a variety of cargo, including chemicals, fertilizers, agricultural produce, and other bulk commodities. Its strategic location near industrial areas and connectivity to Tamil Nadu's hinterlands support the state's economic activities.​
